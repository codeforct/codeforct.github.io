<h2>What is Code for Connecticut?</h2>
Code for Connecticut is a volunteer Civic Technology meetup. We are part of the [Code for America Brigade network](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/about), and are made up of developers, designers, data geeks, citizen activists, and many others who use creative technology to solve civic and social problems.

<h2>What is Civic Technology?</h2>
The definition of civic tech can be quite unclear sometimes - here is a great starting point: [#CivicTech Primer: What is “civic tech”](https://medium.com/@grodeska/civictech-primer-what-is-civic-tech-7ea788e766d3#.lr9joeu39)?

The gist of it is that civic tech is using technology in a creative way to help better the lives of individuals in our communities, whether that is through person-to-person interactions, or via person-to-government interactions.

<h2>Code for America</h2>
Code for Connecticut is part of the [Brigade Network](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/about) of Code for America. Learn more about [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/).

<h2>How We Work</h2>
We'll be meeting up regularly to talk about techology, design, policy, our communities, and more. We collaborate within our community and with other communities worldwide on [GitHub](https://github.com/codeforct).
