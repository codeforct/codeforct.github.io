Code for Kentuckiana had our first meeting on March 9, 2017, and it was a great success.

We started the day off with Kehontas Rowe introducing Code for Kentuckiana and its mission, followed by a round of introductions by attendees. We were fortunate to have attendees from a variety of backgrounds, including, but not limited to, social work, law, accounting, software development, IT, housing policy, health policy, urban planning, and more. This is a great mix of background and talents, and we firmly believe that solving big issues requires people from a wide range of backgrounds coming together to work on solving them together. Kehontas also spoke with [WAVE 3](http://www.wave3.com/2019/03/10/code-kentuckiana-advocates-technology-public-data/) about CFK.

Following introductions, CFK steering committee members and partners discussed the projects and skill share sessions we had planned for the day and asked the community if they had any projects ideas that they thought CFK should work on.

We then broke up into individual groups to work on projects and skill sharing.

Pat Smith led a skill share on data manipulation and working with geographic data, focusing on the [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/) software packages.

Bret Walker led a skill share on open records requests. The group talked about the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Kentucky Open Records Act (KORA) and how they dictate what records are considered open and how to request them. They also looked at [Muckrock](https://www.muckrock.com), an online tool for submitting and managing open records requests, and discussed several completed open records requests from the site. The presentation can be found [here](/img/2019-04-01-first-meeting-receap/open_records.pdf).

Michael Schnuerle, Louisville’s Data Officer, led a group discussion about the city’s open data portal and open data in general.

Loren Hill organized and led a discussion around our renters’ rights project, technical assistance was provided by Kehontas. Partners from [Kentucky Equal Justice Center](https://www.kyequaljustice.org), [Metropolitan Housing Coalition](http://www.metropolitanhousing.org), and [Louisville Metro Housing Authority](http://www.lmha1.org) participated in discussions about the needs of renters and problems they face. We discussed the challenge of renters losing their deposits upon lease termination and the tools/information that could prevent this problem. Ultimately, we plan to create a full-service portal for directing renters to capture and track important information at every stage of tenancy. The app would also connect renters to information about their rights and generate documents and letters. Other possible functionalities of this app include making and tracking maintenance requests, tracking eviction rates of landlords, and helping tenants report rent to credit bureaus to assist in building credit. A good portion of the discussion was focused on the accessibility of this app for people of varying technology experience.
