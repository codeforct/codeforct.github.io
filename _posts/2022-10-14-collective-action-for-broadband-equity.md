At [Brigade Congress](https://codeforamerica.org/brigade-congress-2022/), we will have a dedicated virtual-first action track—similar to National Day of Civic Hacking—on broadband access.

Access to fast, reliable internet means access to education, jobs, services, and democratic participation. Join Code for America and [KC Digital Drive](https://www.kcdigitaldrive.org/) on Saturday, October 15th at 3pm ET/2pm CT to:

Gather high-quality evidence that state broadband offices can use to challenge the FCC broadband maps and ensure that no community is denied the opportunity to benefit from upgraded infrastructure.
Construct a rich database of information about broadband availability and pricing for communities across the United States, allowing for analysis that could inform efforts to uncover instances of price discrimination, digital redlining, and other practices of concern.
All civic technologists, advocates, and organizers are welcome!
